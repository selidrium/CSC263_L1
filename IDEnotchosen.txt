One of the IDEs that I did not choose to use for this course is Eclipse. Eclipse is a popular open-source IDE that is widely used for developing applications in various programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. However, I decided not to use Eclipse because I found it to be relatively heavy and sluggish compared to the IDE that I ultimately chose. Additionally, Eclipse's user interface can be overwhelming for beginners, and its learning curve can be steeper than other IDEs. Finally, while Eclipse has a wide range of plugins and extensions, many of them are outdated, which can cause compatibility issues with newer versions of the software.
