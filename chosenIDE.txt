The IDE that I chose to use for this class is IntelliJ IDEA. I chose IntelliJ because it is a powerful and feature-rich IDE that is specifically designed for Java development. IntelliJ has many helpful features, such as intelligent code completion, code navigation, and debugging tools that make coding in Java faster and more efficient. Additionally, IntelliJ has a clean and intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers alike. Finally, IntelliJ has a strong community of developers and a wealth of documentation and resources available online, which can be helpful when learning new features or troubleshooting issues.
