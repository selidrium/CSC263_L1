GitHub is primarily used as a code repository, which means you can use it to host your projects and code samples. This allows potential employers to see your code and your development process. You can also use GitHub to collaborate with others, which can show employers that you have experience working in a team environment. Additionally, GitHub Pages allows you to create a static website, which you can use to showcase your portfolio. You can use the website to display your work experience, projects, skills, and other relevant information. This provides potential employers with a single place to see your work and get to know you better.
